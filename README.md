## 📌 Key Features

✅ **Single Page Navigation**  
The entire website behaves like a true Single Page Application (SPA). Thanks to **React Router**, navigating between pages (like Home, Menu, About, Contact) doesn’t reload the page — providing a smooth user experience.

✅ **React Hooks for State Management**  
State is managed using `useState`, `useEffect`, and shared via **React context or props**. This ensures that user interactions (like cart items, selected dishes, or preferences) persist across the site without full page reloads.

✅ **Responsive Design**  
Custom **CSS3 styling** makes the site look great across devices — whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

✅ **Fast Performance**  
No backend/API call needed for core navigation. Everything is rendered client-side — ensuring faster load times.

✅ **Data Sharing Without Refresh**  
All component states and user interactions are preserved across navigations — no need for reloading or fetching again.
